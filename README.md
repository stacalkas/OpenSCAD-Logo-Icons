OpenSCAD_Nightly.svg & OpenSCAD_Release.svg  -  SVG versions of icons

To use new icons on Windows:
1. Place ico files in C:\Program Files\OpenSCAD or C:\Program Files\OpenSCAD (Nightly)
2. Right-click on shortcut -> Select properties
3. Select Change Icon
4. Select Desired icon (NOTE: These icons do not have to be placed in an OpenSCAD folder. I placed them there, to make it easier to switch back to the default icons)
5. Select OK
6. Select Apply
7. Select OK

This is to compare icon sizes against light and dark backgrounds
